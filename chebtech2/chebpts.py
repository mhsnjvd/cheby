    %CHEBPTS   Chebyshev points in [-1, 1].
    %   CHEBPTS(N) returns N Chebyshev points of the 2nd kind in [-1,1].
    %
    %   [X, W] = CHEBPTS(N) returns also a row vector of the weights for
    %   Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature (computed using Waldvogel's method: [1], [2]).
    %
    %   [X, W, V] = CHEBPTS(N) returns, in addition to X and W, the barycentric
    %   weights V corresponding to the Chebyshev points X. The barycentric weights
    %   are normalised to have infinity norm equal to 1 and a positive first entry.
    %
    %   [X, W, V, T] = CHEBPTS(N) returns also the angles of X.
