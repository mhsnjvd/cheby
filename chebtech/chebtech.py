#     [ISHAPPY, CUTOFF] = CLASSICCHECK(F, VALUES, DATA) returns an estimated
#     location, the CUTOFF, at which the CHEBTECH F could be truncated to
#     maintain an accuracy of EPSLEVEL (see documentation below) relative to
#     DATA.VSCALE and DATA.HSCALE. ISHAPPY is TRUE if the representation is
#     "happy" in the sense described further below and FALSE otherwise.
#     
#     [ISHAPPY, CUTOFF] = CLASSICCHECK(F, VALUES, DATA, PREF) allows additional
#     preferences to be passed. In particular, one can adjust the target accuracy
#     with PREF.CHEBFUNEPS.
#     
#     CLASSICCHECK first queries HAPPINESSREQUIREMENTS to obtain TESTLENGTH and
#     EPSLEVEL (see documentation below). If |F.COEFFS(1:TESTLENGTH)|/VSCALE <
#     EPSLEVEL, then the representation defined by F.COEFFS is deemed happy. The
#     value returned in CUTOFF is essentially that from TESTLENGTH (although it
#     can be reduced if there are further COEFFS which fall below EPSLEVEL).
#     
#     HAPPINESSREQUIREMENTS defines what it means for a CHEBTECH to be happy.
#     [TESTLENGTH, EPSLEVEL] = HAPPINESSREQUIREMENTS(VALUES, COEFFS, POINTS,
#     DATA, EPS) returns two scalars TESTLENGTH and EPSLEVEL.  POINTS 
#     is the vector of points at which F was sampled to get the values in 
#     VALUES.  EPS is the desired accuracy.  A CHEBTECH is deemed to be 
#     'happy' if the coefficients COEFFS(END-TESTLENGTH+1:END) (recall that 
#     COEFFS are stored in ascending order) are all below EPSLEVEL.  The 
#     default choice of the test length is:
#         TESTLENGTH = n,             for n = 1:4
#         TESTLENGTH = 5,             for n = 5:44
#         TESTLENGTH = round((n-1)/8) for n > 44
#     
#     EPSLEVEL is essentially the maximum of:
#         * pref.chebfuneps
#         * eps*TESTLENGTH
#         * eps*condEst (where condEst is an estimate of the condition number
#                        based upon a finite difference approximation to the
#                        gradient of the function from VALUES.).
#     However, the final two estimated values can be no larger than 1e-4.
#     
#     Note that the accuracy check implemented in this function is (roughly) the
#     same as that employed in Chebfun v4.x.
