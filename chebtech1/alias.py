    """ ALIAS   Alias Chebyshev coefficients on the 1st kind Chebyshev grid.
        ALIAS(C, M) aliases the Chebyshev coefficients stored in the column vector C
        to have length M. If M > LENGTH(C), the coefficients are padded with zeros.
        If C is a matrix of coefficients, each of the columns is aliased to length
        M.

      % different from that for the 2nd-kind grid, even though the coefficients 
      % being aliased are for 1st-kind Chebyshev polynomials in both cases.
