    %CHEBPTS   Chebyshev points of 1st kind in [-1, 1].
    %   CHEBPTS(N) returns N Chebyshev points of the 1st kind in [-1, 1].
    %
    %   [X, W] = CHEBPTS(N) returns also a row vector of the weights for
    %   Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature (computed using [1,2] ).
    %
    %   [X, W, V] = CHEBPTS(N) returns, in addition to X and W, the weights V
    %   for barycentric polynomial interpolation in the Chebyshev points X.
    %
    %   [X, W, V, T] = CHEBPTS(N) returns also the angles of X.
